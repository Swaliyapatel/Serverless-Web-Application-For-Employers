# Serverless-Web-Application-For-Employers
:Server-less computing allows us to build and run applications and services without thinking about server. Server-less applications donâ€™t require you to provision, scale and manage any severs.  So here I created server-less Web Application for Employers which has 2 web pages.  1.Post Employee details   It Post all data, related to that employer in DynamoDB database.  2.Get Employee Details  It takes input as Email ID as a searched parameter which we already enter in Post Employee details Form and then it gives all employee details associated with that Email-ID.  I build a server-less web application in AWS Cloud using API gateway, Lambda function, DynamoDB and S3bucket.
